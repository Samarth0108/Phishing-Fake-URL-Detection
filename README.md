# Phishing-Fake-URL-Detection

Cybercrimes all over the world are immensely increasing due to the advancement in technology and evolution of digitalization. Phishing is a fraudulent activity and it aims at stealing a user’s confidential information such as passwords, bank details, login id’s, etc using tricky techniques. The attacker seems to be legitimate in these frauds and it is very difficult to differentiate between the real and fake as there is very minute difference in them. These crimes are increasing everyday. According to the records, around 82,000 frauds were registered in the year 2023. And the main reason is that the people are not aware of it and also they do not have any method to detect it. In this paper, we propose two machine learning algorithms which are Random Forest and Decision Tree and Autoencoder Neural Network. After training the model with sufficient dataset, we come to the conclusion that among the three algorithms that are used, Decision Tree has achieved a good performance in predicting the fake URL’s. Therefore, our approach can alert the online users about the phishing website whenever they would try to access it through the URL.
